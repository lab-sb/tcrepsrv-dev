TCapture Installation
===========================

Install PostgreSQL
---------------------------

Since TCapture is a software for implementing data replication of Postgresql databases,  begin by `installing PostgreSQL`_.

.. note:: TCapture currently supports PostgreSQL versions 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, and 11.0 on **64-bit architectures**.

.. _`installing PostgreSQL`: https://www.postgresql.org/download/

Install TCapture 
---------------------------

Once you have PostgreSQL installed on your system, you just need to install the TCapture software and then execute the configuration scripts within your PostgreSQL database. You can download tarball package  from our release archives and install them directly.

.. code-block:: sh 
	
		Download zip from  https://github.com/lab-sb/tcrepsrv-dev 
		cd /var/lib/pgsql/scripts/mycode/
		unzip tcrepsrv-dev-master.zip 
	
	or
		git clone https://github.com/lab-sb/tcrepsrv-dev.git

	as root: 
	cd tcrepsrv-dev  directory 
	 execute install.sh under TCapture software folder
	./install.sh  #cover the following steps:

	- set variable RDBBDR HOME in .rdbbdr_env.sh	
	- soruce environment file .rdbbdr_env.sh
	- installing TCapture logical decoding library under /usr/pgsql-10/lib

	examples.
	1- echo "export RDBBDR=/var/lib/pgsql/scripts/mycode/rdbbdr" > .rdbbdr_env.sh
	2-. .rdbbdr_env.sh
	3-echo $RDBBDR
	4-/var/lib/pgsql/scripts/mycode/rdbbdr
	5-cd $RDBBDR
	6-cp ./rdbbdr/lib/rdb_decoder/rdblogdec.so /usr/pgsql-10/lib/



Configuring a primary database node 
----------------------------------
 check out the :ref:`addproducer` section. !

PostgreSQL hba Configuration
---------------------

By default, PostgreSQL is not configured to allow incoming connections from remote hosts. To enable incoming connections, first set the following line in :code:`postgresql.conf`:

.. code-block:: sh

    listen_addresses = '*'

And in :code:`pg_hba.conf`, add a line such as the following to allow incoming connections:

.. code-block:: sh

    host    all             all             <ip address>/<subnet>            md5


For example, to allow incoming connections from any host:

.. code-block:: sh

    host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0            md5

Running PostgreSQL
---------------------

To run the PostgreSQL server in the background, use the :code:`pg_ctl` driver and point it to your newly initialized data directory:

.. code-block:: sh

	pg_ctl -D <data directory> -l postgresql.log start



Now youâ€™re ready to start using TCapture check out the :ref:`addproducer` section. !
